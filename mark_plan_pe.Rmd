### When and Sources

Performance evaluation for P.R.O.V. will be conducted on a quarterly basis during the first year of launch to monitor market traction, product reception, and promotional success. Key performance indicators (KPIs) will include unit sales, customer satisfaction survey responses, website and social media engagement, event attendance, and partnership growth with healthcare providers.

#### Evaluation Sources:

- Sales Data: Monthly and quarterly sales volume compared to projections.

- Survey Feedback: Insights from consumer surveys conducted online and in-person at clinics and events.

- Digital Analytics: Website traffic, social media engagement, click-through rates on ads, and QR code usage from printed materials.

- Retailer Feedback: Reports on customer inquiries, product satisfaction, and demand at point-of-sale.

- Event Performance: Workshop attendance, participant feedback, and follow-up engagement (e.g., consultations booked, VIP redemptions).

- Market Reports: Ongoing review of industry data from sources like Grand View Research, Ossur, Ottobock, and Blatchford, to track overall market trends and adjust forecasts.

Evaluating these metrics consistently will help P.R.O.V. identify areas of strength and opportunities for improvement, allowing the brand to stay adaptive and consumer-focused in a competitive industry.
