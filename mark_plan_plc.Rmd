## Life Cycle

The product life cycle has four stages, those being: 

#### 1) Birth

Prosthetic and orthotic brands are typically not well-known unless specifically researched, as the average consumer doesn’t encounter these products in their daily life. Therefore, P.R.O.V. must establish a strong presence on platforms where our target market is already active and engaged.

#### 2) Growth

In the growth stage, the product is introduced to the target market with a focus on highlighting its benefits. Our promotional strategy includes partnerships with clinics and rehabilitation centers. Winners of the promotion will receive a free consultation and fitting for a prosthetic or orthotic device, along with tickets to a brand-hosted event and workshop. These initiatives aim to increase brand awareness and build a positive reputation within the target market.

#### 3) Maturity

Once a relationship with the consumer is established, the maturity stage focuses on customer retention and product expansion. Recurring customers may seek to explore additional offerings, while new customers are likely to be referred by satisfied clients. Given the niche nature of the market, word-of-mouth and reputation play a key role in sustaining growth.

#### 4) Obsolescence

Obsolescence may occur if the target market loses interest in our offerings or if our brand no longer aligns with their needs or values. When this happens, we will emphasize the unique benefits of our products over competitors and explore innovative directions to re-engage the market and remain relevant.
