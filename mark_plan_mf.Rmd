P.R.O.V. is utilizing a trend-based forecasting model to project future growth, based on patterns within the prosthetics and orthotics industry. This approach examines current market trends, demographic shifts, and technology adoption to predict demand. With a global market growth rate estimated between 4.5%–5.8% CAGR, and increasing demand for personalized mobility solutions, the outlook is strong for a specialized, quality-driven brand like P.R.O.V.

### Year 1 (Launch Phase):

In our first year, P.R.O.V. forecasts around 100 units sold, driven by our targeted promotions, partnerships with clinics and rehabilitation centers, and a strong launch campaign. This number is based on limited regional distribution, allowing us to focus on customer feedback, product refinement, and establishing a reputation for quality and innovation.

### Year 2–3 (Growth Phase):

With expanded brand recognition and trusted relationships with healthcare providers, we expect a 30–40% annual increase in sales. By the end of Year 3, we project reaching 400–500 units sold per year. Marketing efforts will focus on continued advertising in healthcare publications, word-of-mouth referrals, and increased community engagement through workshops and events.

### Year 4–5 (Expansion Phase):

Assuming consistent demand and a broadened product offering, P.R.O.V. aims to exceed 700 units per year by Year 5. Expansion into additional service areas and adjacent markets, such as pediatric orthotics or wearable support accessories, will help sustain growth. Enhancements to packaging, logistics, and customer support will support our scalability.
This trend-based model supports a stable, strategic approach to market entry and growth. With a clear focus on quality, community, and customer experience, P.R.O.V. is positioned to grow alongside rising industry demand and continue delivering value to both patients and providers.
