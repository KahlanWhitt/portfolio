<br>

At the heart of this boutique consultancy is a lifelong dedication to building meaningful connections across the global art ecosystem. As the founder, I bring a strategic, internationally informed approach to bridging curators, collectors, investors, museums, and galleries with opportunities that align with their cultural vision and long-term goals.

My career path has been shaped by a deep commitment to personal growth, education, and intentional planning. Early in my professional journey, I recognized the value of maintaining a balanced life, mentally, socially, financially, and creatively. While my primary focus has always been on career and intellectual development, I believe that success is built on a foundation of continuous learning, cultural curiosity, and thoughtful relationship-building.

My professional aim has long been clear: to work at the intersection of art, culture, and strategy, helping institutions and individuals navigate the complex relationships that bring historical and contemporary art to global audiences. This mission has guided every stage of my development, from academic planning and international study to hands-on industry experience and cross-cultural exploration.

I have pursued business education with a focus on management to strengthen the strategic side of my work, while simultaneously cultivating connections within the art world through mentors, industry conversations, and on-the-ground experience. My international background, combined with both American and European citizenship, has allowed me to gain a nuanced understanding of how different cultural environments shape the operations of museums, galleries, and art institutions.

Travel has been a key influence on my professional philosophy. I have spent extensive time visiting historical museums and exhibitions across Europe, speaking with managers, curators, and cultural leaders to better understand the unique needs and perspectives of each region. These experiences inform my consultancy’s approach: globally aware, culturally sensitive, and strategically driven.

Today, my work brings together everything I value: relationship management, cross-cultural insight, strategic problem-solving, and a genuine passion for the arts. My goal is to ensure that every collaboration I facilitate is meaningful, intentional, and aligned with the artistic and financial aspirations of my clients.

This consultancy exists to connect vision with opportunity, and I am committed to helping clients navigate the art world with clarity, creativity, and confidence. Whether you are a curator seeking new partnerships, a museum aiming to expand international relationships, or an investor exploring culturally significant projects, I am here to help you build connections that resonate.
