## Analytical Strength

Alongside a strong foundation in art history and cultural insight, Vellum Advising Co. integrates advanced analytical capabilities to support informed, strategic decision-making.
In a global art environment where valuation, provenance, audience trends, and institutional capacity matter more than ever, the ability to interpret data thoughtfully becomes a powerful advantage.

Our analytical expertise strengthens every client partnership by ensuring that recommendations are not only culturally intuitive, but also grounded in measurable evidence, operational reasoning, and strategic foresight.

#### **Analysis & Strategy:**

We apply data-driven thinking to help clients navigate opportunities within the art world. This includes:

- Conducting quantitative analysis in R to evaluate exhibition patterns, collector trends, and market indicators.
- Performing data cleaning and transformation to turn raw information into reliable, decision-ready insights.
- Using statistical techniques to identify meaningful patterns, risks, and opportunities relevant to acquisitions, loans, or curatorial planning.
- Integrating both qualitative and quantitative information to support balanced, well-reasoned strategies.

Whether assessing the potential of a new exhibition, evaluating donor activity, or preparing acquisition justifications, our analytical approach ensures every recommendation rests on a solid foundation.

#### **Visualization & Reporting:**

Presenting information clearly is just as important as analyzing it. Vellum specializes in transforming complex findings into clean, compelling narratives that support informed communication across institutions.

Capabilities include:

- Creating professional-grade data visualizations using ggplot2
- Building reproducible reports in R Markdown for internal teams, partners, or board presentations
- Designing data storytelling that communicates insights to both business audiences and cultural stakeholders
- Tailoring reports that translate technical findings into meaningful strategic guidance

Our goal is to make data accessible, visually clear, and directly linked to actionable outcomes.

#### **Data Sources & Integration:**

To support flexible and accurate analysis, we work with a variety of data sources, including:

- CSV and spreadsheet-based datasets
- Government open data portals and APIs
- Cultural sector, nonprofit, and business performance datasets
- Operational metrics from galleries, museums, or event partners (when available)

This versatility ensures that regardless of the scope or origin of the information, Vellum Advising Co. can analyze, interpret, and integrate it into thoughtful recommendations for clients.
