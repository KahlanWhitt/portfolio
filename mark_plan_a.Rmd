### Media Selection with Justification

#### Selection

Target Market Selectivity: This advertising strategy was chosen specifically for its strong alignment with P.R.O.V.’s target market. Medical journals, healthcare newsletters, and clinic waiting room screens are highly selective and relevant channels that are routinely accessed by both healthcare professionals and patients in need of prosthetic or orthotic solutions. By placing advertisements in these mediums, we are ensuring that our brand reaches individuals who are either making decisions about mobility aids for themselves or advising others on such decisions—such as doctors, rehabilitation specialists, and caregivers. These environments provide a credible and trusted setting, which enhances the perceived authority and legitimacy of our brand.

Furthermore, many patients undergoing treatment or rehabilitation often spend time in clinic waiting areas where their attention is naturally drawn to digital screens or printed materials. This provides an excellent opportunity for P.R.O.V. to introduce its brand, technology, and core values in a calm, informative setting. Compared to mass media, this approach minimizes wasted impressions and maximizes relevance and impact, making it a cost-effective and targeted advertising solution.

#### Purpose 

The primary purpose of advertising through medical and clinical channels is to build brand awareness and trust within a highly qualified audience. These ads will not focus on promotions, but rather on educating the viewer about who P.R.O.V. is, what our products offer, and how our solutions can improve quality of life. The advertisements will highlight P.R.O.V.’s commitment to innovation, personalized care, and community support—resonating with individuals who value medical credibility and long-term mobility solutions.

Additionally, this form of advertising aims to position P.R.O.V. as a trusted partner in the rehabilitation journey, encouraging patients to ask their clinicians about our brand or visit our website for more information. By aligning with credible sources and being present in the spaces where mobility solutions are actively discussed, we increase the likelihood of becoming a top-of-mind option when it matters most—during the decision-making phase of the patient’s journey.
